## Summary
ANZSoilML is a GML application schema that specifies a set of feature-types and supporting structures for information used in the Australian and New Zealand soil sciences. It is primarily concerned with observed properties of Soils and associated Landscapes as specified in the:
- _Australian Soil and Land Survey Field Handbook, Third edition, 2009, The National Committee on Soil and Terrain._
- New Zealand _Soil Description Handbook, Revised edition, 1995, Milne, J.D.G., Clayden, B., Singleton, P.L., Wilson, A.D._

ANZSoilML was derived from OzSoilML, which was developed under the auspices of the Australian Collaborative Land Evaluation Program (ACLEP) http://www.clw.csiro.au/aclep/.
