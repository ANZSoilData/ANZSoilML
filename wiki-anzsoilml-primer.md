## Introduction
ANZSoilML specifies the set of classes, properties, relationships and supporting vocabularies needed to structure
digital information used in the Australian and New Zealand soil sciences. It is primarily concerned with observed
properties of soils and their associated landscape features as specified in the:
- _Australian Soil and Land Survey Field Handbook, Third edition, 2009, The National Committee on Soil and Terrain._
([CSIRO Publishing](https://www.publish.csiro.au/book/5230/))
- _New Zealand Soil Description Handbook, Revised edition, 1995, Milne, J.D.G., Clayden, B., Singleton, P.L., Wilson,
A.D._ ([Manaaki Whenua Digital Library](http://digitallibrary.landcareresearch.co.nz/cdm/ref/collection/p20022coll14/id/79))

ANZSoilML is subdivided into packages according to the parts of the environment the model describes (soil and
landscapes) or how soil data are collected and used (soil sampling). An additional package, Global Soil Map (GSM),
attempts to align the ANZSoilML model with soil property predictions made by the GSM community. To ensure consistency
with other environmental datasets it also imports packages from important standards for observation and sampling data
([Observations and Measurements 2.0 (O&M)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observations_and_Measurements)), and geology
([GeoScience Mark-up Language 3.0 (GeoSciML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoSciML)).
